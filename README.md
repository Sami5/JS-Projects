**SmallestMultiple.js** - This is my original solution to the Free Code Camp algorithm challenge "Smallest Common Multiple". The aim of the challenge was to find the smallest common multiple among a range of numbers. The more concise and efficient solution uses the Euclidean algorithm but I'm still proud of finding a solution using prime factorisation! :grinning:
