Random Javascript projects

**SmallestMultiple.js** - This is my original solution to the freeCodeCamp algorithm challenge "Smallest Common Multiple". The aim of the challenge was to find the smallest common multiple among a range of numbers. The more concise and efficient solution uses the Euclidean algorithm but I'm still proud of finding a solution using prime factorisation! :grinning:

**CashRegister.js** - This solution is based on the freeCodeCamp algorithm challenge "Exact Change". The aim of the challenge was to return the change due (listed by denomination and amount) based on the denomination available in the cash register. :dollar:

**Inventory.js** - Solution to the freeCodeCamp algorithm challenge "Inventory Update". The aim of the exercise was to update your current inventory with the items from a fresh delivery. If the item already exists just update the quantity otherwise add the entire item. :strawberry:

**DateRange.js** - This solution is based on the freeCodeCamp algorithm challenge "Friendly Date Ranges". The objective was to output the date range in a more readable format and is based on factors such as whether the date range occurred in the same year, same month etc. :date:

**RomanNumeral.js** - This is the solution to the freeCodeCamp algorithm challenge "Roman Numeral Converter". This does as the name suggests and converts a number to it's roman numeral equivalent. :watch:
