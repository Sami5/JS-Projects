Random Javascript projects

**SmallestMultiple.js** - This is my original solution to the freeCodeCamp algorithm challenge "Smallest Common Multiple". The aim of the challenge was to find the smallest common multiple among a range of numbers. The more concise and efficient solution uses the Euclidean algorithm but I'm still proud of finding a solution using prime factorisation! :grinning:

**CashRegister.js** - This solution is based on the freeCodeCamp algorithm challenge "Exact Change". The aim of the challenge is to return the change due (listed by denomination and amount) based on the denomination available in the cash register. :dollar:

**Inventory.js** - Solution to the freeCodeCamp algorithm challenge "Inventory Update", where the aim of the exercise is to update your current inventory with the items from a fresh delivery. If the item already exists just update the quantity otherwise add the entire item. :strawberry:
